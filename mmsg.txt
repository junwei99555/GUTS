May peace and contentment bless your life with the joy that endures ever season. 
Have an awesome day. 
The secret of happiness is just this: Positive mind, Positive vibes, Positive Life. 
Stay Positive and Have an Awesome day.
Life becomes much easier when you realize that you can't have everything "permanent" in a "temporary" life.
Hey! Have a great day ahead!
If you can combine positive actions with a positive mindset, you will surely achieve success. Have a great day.
The secret of being happy does not lie in getting more, but in giving more.
Each morning brings with it a new opportunity, seize it.
Failure is not the opposite of Success, but just a part of it. Remember that always.
Most people just dream about success while others put their head down and make it happen.
Losers spend their time waiting for a perfect moment. Winners take a moment and then "make it perfect".
It's a beautiful day to work
